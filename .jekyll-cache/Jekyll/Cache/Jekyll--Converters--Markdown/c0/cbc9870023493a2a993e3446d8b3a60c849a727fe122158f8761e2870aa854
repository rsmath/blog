I"ú<p>As I begin my PhD, I am starting a regular blogging routine.</p>

<p>I am a Computing PhD student at the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah (visit my <a href="https://rsmath.github.io/">website</a> for more info). I really like this quote from one of  Professor Matt Might‚Äôs <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/grad-student-resolutions/">blogs</a>, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt produce 140 characters of syntactically correct thought per day, maybe grad school is not for you‚Äù. Writing regularly is crucial for innumerable reasons. Especially as a graduate student, writing my thoughts down coherently is helpful. I do tweet quite a bit, sometimes random/very interesting/pseudo-philosophical things, but 140 characters is not enough for more structured writing going forward :)</p>

<p>My old blog posts are archived. Over time, I expect this habit to refine itself. While I will not be posting specifics about my research, I will write about what I am learning/doing at any time plus any thoughts I just want to write down. There is no template for a graduate student blog, so whatever form this takes will be mine own. I will likely not use any headings or major formatting unless I really need to, I like to write without any formatting interruptions.</p>

<p>I do not know how often I will post. But I hope to post at least twice a week or when I need to write something down. Definitely not daily though.</p>
