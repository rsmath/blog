<p>Hi, my name is Ram! I am a Junior Machine Learning Engineera at <a href="https://omdena.com/">Omdena</a>, <a href="http://deeplearning.ai/">deeeplearning.ai</a> ambassador, and a Microsoft Student Partner at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.</p>

<p>As William Glasser puts it -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦We learn 95% of what we teach to someone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, through this blog, I want to explain some concepts of Machine Learning to my readers.
This is because I have been told many times that Computer Science is clerical work, devoid of any true
thinking. With respect to this appalling sense, I want my readers to see just how sophisticated and fun
the world of Computer Science can be!</p>
