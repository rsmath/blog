title:  Week 1 of my PhD
excerpt: Today marks the end of the first week of my PhD. Some thoughts.

I labeled this post the end of the first week even though I will probably still come back to the office tomorrow.

My first week of the PhD was awesome! Graduate school is exactly as I imagined it would be. I have a packed schedule this semester. Two classes plus one Fluid Dynamics class I am sitting in on on top of my research. The classes I am taking are more intellectually demanding than I expected, but I updated my priors now. It is really refreshing to be in a class that requires me to really think about things.

Me and my lab partner also got an office assigned to us! This is extremely cool. And the place has an incredible view :)

I am officially seated in the Warnock Engineering Building, Office 2883. I also got my new Framework laptop. It was a joy to set up the same Ubuntu on both the work computer and my laptop. At the time of writing, I have configured app level shortcuts, removed the dock, configured the Kitty terminal (and all of its shortcuts), several basic browser and communication apps, Vim, LaTeX, and coding environments (including CUDA on the work computer's NVIDIA RTX 4080). Turns out, setting up CUDA on Linux is extremely easy. And PyTorch C++ too.

Right now, I have one homework to complete for HPC, and formal math to start writing for a very cool idea my advisor and I discussed last Thursday, and to start coding it. My furniture at home is complete now which allows me to get work done far more efficiently than sitting on the ground.
